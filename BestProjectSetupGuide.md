### `assets/`

This folder contains static assets such as images, fonts, and other media files used throughout the application.

### `components/`

Contains reusable React components that can be used across various parts of the application.

### `ui/`

This directory includes UI-specific components like buttons, forms, modals, and other elements related to the user interface.

### `hooks/`

Custom hooks for abstracting and reusing logic across different components. Examples include `useDebounce` and `useFetchAPI`.

### `pages/`

Contains React components that correspond to different pages of the application. For instance, `About.tsx`, `Contact.tsx`, and `Home.tsx` represent different routes in the app.

### `services/`

This directory is subdivided into:

- `api/`: For API interaction logic.
- `providers/`: For context providers and related utilities.
- `state/`: For managing global state using solutions like Redux or Context API.

### `utils/`

Contains utility functions and helpers such as formatters and general-purpose functions used throughout the application.

### Root Files

- **`App.tsx`**: The main App component where the applicationâ€™s root component is defined.
- **`index.css`**: Global CSS styles.
- **`main.tsx`**: The entry point of the application where the React app is rendered to the DOM.
